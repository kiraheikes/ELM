# ELM (Embryonic Lineage in MatLab)
The included MatLab script can be used to generate a plotted lineage from mean cell division data collected over a population of embryos.

To understand the script, use the example file included with mean data generated from 9 embryos of the species Hypsibius exemplaris over the first seven rounds of division.
For this example, you must have the script and the excel file saved in the same folder on your computer and you must specify the excel spreadsheet ranges to pull the data from in the top of the MatLab script.
